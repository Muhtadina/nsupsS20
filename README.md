# NSU Problem Solvers Bootcamp Season 20 
In 2024, I had attended **[NSU Problem Solvers Pre-Bootcamp Season 19](https://vjudge.net/contest/639029)** and was selected for **[Selection Contest S19](https://vjudge.net/contest/655124#overview)**. Unfortunately, I could not make it to the Graduation Contest due to irregularity. So, I started the Bootcamp again in 2025, took part in **[NSU PS Selection Contest Season 20](https://vjudge.net/contest/688224#overview)** on 24 January 2025.
